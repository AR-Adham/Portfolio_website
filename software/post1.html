      <h1>Fox and Cayote enclosure simulation</h1>
      <p>Me and my APSC 103 group, developed an agent-based simulation to model the interactions of foxes and coyotes within wildlife enclosures, 
        using Python, NumPy, and Pygame. The back-end was designed to capture animal movement, behavior, and population dynamics, 
        while the front-end included interactive sliders, buttons, and progress bars for user-controlled parameters. 
        The simulation was applied to the Sandy Pines Wildlife Centre, where it supported analysis of trap placement and enclosure mapping strategies. 
        This project enhanced my skills in object-oriented programming, data structures, and user interface design, 
        while demonstrating how computational modeling can contribute to ecological management and informed decision-making.</p>
      <p>My main role on the project was developing the brain of the Cannids, aswell as developing the architechture in which the simulation ran. 
        The brain was a engine which based on the frequency since foxes or cayotes had last done something would pick its next decision, the wheights of how 
        frequently foxes decided what to do came from academic research. The architechture of the simulation was a 3d array which tracked diffrent information for each layer
        such as fox locations, diffrent terain, diffrent family locations, food locations etc.
